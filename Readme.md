# What is ANTLR Tool

   * This simple tool is designed to work with ANTLR and more specifically antlr4cs https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/antlr4cs
   * Its purpose is to generate the lexer, parser, visitor etc classes for C#
   * It allows to easily generate these files using visual studio 2019 because the antlr extensions I found for visual studio are outdated now.
   * It requires java to be installed on your machine.
